# Smoodify
Smoodify uses spotify's personalization algorithm to recommend you the songs you might like, and also allows you to create playlists based on your current mood.


To Use: </br>
-> Create a spotify developer account and get your client_id, client_secret, and redirect ui</br>
-> Create your auth code by converting *cliend_id*:*client_secret* to a base 64 format and save it in a variable called *auth_code*</br>
-> store your *auth_code*, *client_id*, and *redirect_ui* in a .env file</br>
-> Your're good to go now!</br>
